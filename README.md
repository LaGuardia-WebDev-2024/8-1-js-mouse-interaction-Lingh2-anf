## Directions

### Step #1 - Bigger bite! <br>

Before we make this program respond to mouse interaction, let's make a little change. See the bite in the tomato? It's tiny now, make it bigger!
<br><br>
Tip: the bite is being drawn as an ellipse. To make it bigger, you have to replace the width and height of the bite ellipse with numbers greater than 30.
<br><br>

### Step #2 - Prepare to eat! <br>

Right now, there's just one bite in this tomato - but we want to be able to eat it all! We can do that by drawing a new bite everytime the user moves the mouse. The first step is to move the bite drawing code into the draw() function.
<br><br>
Remember: moving code into a function - or putting it inside a function - means putting the code between the {curly braces} that appear after the function.
<br><br>
Tip: You can select and drag the bite drawing code to easily move it around.
<br><br>

### Step #3 - Eat it! <br>

Now, to make it so that we can make more bites when we move the mouse, you need to change the x and the y coordinates of the bite to be based on `mouseX` and `mouseY` instead. To check that it works, just move your mouse!
<br><br>

### Step #4 - Change the CSS! <br>

Open the style.css file and adjust the styling of this page - change the background, change at least two colors in the .css file, and udd a font-family.
